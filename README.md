🎧 Kavyasree-351 — Code, Curiosity & a Dash of Creativity

Hey there! I’m Kavyasree — a curious mind with a love for building, learning, and a little bit of pixel-perfect fun.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
- 🌱 Currently diving into **machine learning, neural networks, and image classification**  
- 🔍 Still figuring it all out — but every model trained is a step forward  
- 🧠 Fascinated by how machines learn to *see* and *understand*
- 🤝 Open to collaborative projects that spark curiosity and growth


 
## ✨ A Bit More About Me
- 🗣 Pronouns: she/her  
- 🌟 Fun Fact: I don't drink coffee or tea... still surviving tech life 😅  
- 🎧 Bonus Vibe: Learning to code one bug at a time — lo-fi helps, but so does a nap
